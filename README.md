The aim of this python example is to make an interactive model of a 3d sphere that can be moved to highlight the hopf fibers.

I would love contributions to this to help expand on it and make a features list of what should be there etc...

This is a new project for me and appreciate any feedback on this!

Todo:

- Adjust Colours
- Scale up the 3d sphere
- remove a section of the sphere completley?
